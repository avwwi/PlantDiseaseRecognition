# PlantDiseaseRecognition
The PlantDiseaseRecognition project involves creating a model to classify images of plant leaves into various categories based on the type of disease or health status.

We are going to train a convolutional neural network to work on the images of plant leaves and categorise them as one of the three categories
1. Healthy
2. Powdery
3. Rust
